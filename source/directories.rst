***********
Directories
***********

The Directory resource is a top-level container for Account and Group resources. A Directory also manages security policies (like password strength) for the Accounts it contains. Directories can be used to cleanly manage segmented user Account populations. For example, you might use one Directory for company employees and another Directory for customers, each with its own security policies.

The `Directories page <https://api.stormpath.com/ui2/index.html#/directorys>`__ contains the list of Directories in your Stormpath Tenant. On this page you can quickly:

- Search for Directories in the top-right search box
- :ref:`Add new Directories <directories-create>` using the "Create Directory" button
- :ref:`Change the status <directories-change-status>` of one or more Directories to: `Enabled` or `Disabled`
- :ref:`Delete one or more Directories <directories-delete>`
- :ref:`Edit an Directory <directories-edit>`

Find a Directory's URL
================================

To find an Directory's unique URL, first click on its name from the main list of Directories. Its URL can be found at the top of the Directory's page, in the field marked "HREF".

Clicking on this URL will open your Directory's information in JSON format and display it in your browser.

.. _directories-create:

Create a Directory
========================

Directories are top-level containers which contain Accounts and Groups. Users that are created and added directly by your application go into **Cloud** Directories. Users that come in from outside sources, like Social Login, LDAP, or SAML-based Identity Providers, are contained in **Mirror** Directories.

You will need as many Mirror Directories as you have sources for users. This means that, if you would like users to log-in via Facebook, then you will need to add a Facebook Directory. If you would also like your users to be able to log in using Salesforce, then you will need also need a SAML Directory configured for Salesforce.

This section will tell you how to:

- :ref:`Create a Cloud Directory <directories-create-cloud>`
- :ref:`Create a Social Directory <directories-create-social>`

  - :ref:`Google <create-google>`
  - :ref:`Facebook <create-facebook>`
  - :ref:`GitHub <create-github>`
  - :ref:`LinkedIn <create-linkedin>`
  - :ref:`Twitter <create-twitter>`
  - :ref:`Generic OAuth <create-generic>`

- :ref:`Create an AD/LDAP Directory <directories-create-ldap>`

- :ref:`Create a SAML Directory <directories-create-saml>`

  - :ref:`Salesforce <create-salesforce>`
  - :ref:`OneLogin <create-onelogin>`
  - :ref:`Okta <create-okta>`
  - :ref:`Ping Identity <create-ping>`
  - :ref:`ADFS <create-adfs>`
  - :ref:`Azure AD <create-azure>`

  The Agent will need a login and password for an account with at least read-access to your LDAP directory.

- **Agent Type:** Here you choose whether this Agent will be for an Active Directory instance, or a different kind of LDAP Directory.
- **Directory Host:** The IP address or host name of the LDAP Directory server.
- **Directory Port:** The port of the LDAP Directory server. The SSL default is ``636`` and the non-SSL default is ``389``.
- **Require SSL:** Should the Agent communicate with your AD/LDAP server over SSL? If so, check this box and configure the Directory's port to accept SSL.
- **Agent User DN:** The Distinguished Name (DN) for the account that the Agent will use.
- **Agent User DN Password:** The password for the account that the Agent will use.
- **Base DN:** The Base Distinguished Name identifies the entry in the directory from which searches initiated by LDAP clients occur.
- **Polling Interval:** Here you enter in how often (in minutes) you would like the Agent to poll the LDAP directory.
